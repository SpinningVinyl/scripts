## A collection of random scripts for macOS

This repository contains some of the scripts that I have written for my personal use over the years.

The scripts are nothing special: I'm not a scripting guru, I'm just a guy who likes to create small snippets of code to automate some of his tasks.

* **wifi** — this script allows you to contain the Wi-Fi adapter built into your Mac programmatically.
* **desktop** — this script toggles desktop icons on and off.
* **ql** — invoke Quick Look from CLI.
* **Toggle Wifi.applescript** — this AppleScript toggles system Wi-Fi on and off. Best used with a lancher, e.g. Keyboard Maestro or FastScripts.

You can use these files as you see fit.
